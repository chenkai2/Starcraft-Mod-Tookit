This program converts Camsys CWAD and SECWAD files to MPQ files.

The program will create a mpq file on the same dir as the original cwad
with the files that were on the cwad.
If everithing goes fine, it will message you with a Dialog like this:

"Done. 13 file were added to: c:\..\myfile.mpq"

If it doesn't, please send me the CWAD file and

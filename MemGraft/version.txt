WinMPQ:
(01) The *.exe file is the file that you load your changes with. It now expects to find the *.mgd file in civilian.mpq, under the name custom\mgpatch.mgd . 
(02) In your StarCraft folder, you will find the file patch_rt.mpq. Make a copy of it, and name the copy civilian.mpq. Open this file in WinMPQ 
(03) Now click add, and open the *.mgd file. A window will pop up asking in which folder to put it in. Write "custom\" (without the ", of course)
(04) Unless the *.mgd file was called mgpatch.mgd, right-click on the file you just added, and select rename. Make sure that the name now is custom\mgpatch.mgd.
(05) Close WinMPQ. All changes you do to the MPQ files are directly saved (in other words, be careful about deleting files - they're not comming back), thus the lack of those buttons in the menu.
How to run:
(01) Now that you've created the patch and put it into an MPQ, all you have to do is to run it. 
(02) Make sure that the MPQ is in the StarCraft directory, and run the *.exe that MemGraft gave you (can be run from anywhere). You should now be able to train Civilians at the Supply Depot!
